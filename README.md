This is the [Node.js monitoring](http://sematext.com/spm/integrations/nodejs-monitoring.html) agent for [SPM performance monitoring](http://sematext.com/spm) from Sematext.

The following information is collected and transmitted to SPM (Cloud or On-Premises version):

- OS Metrics (CPU / Mem)
- Process Memory
- EventLoop stats
- Garbage Collector stats
- Web server stats (requests, error rate, response times etc.)
  Working for all web servers frameworks that use Node.js http/https module including 
  - "connect" based frameworks
  - Express.js, 
  - Sails.js
  - Hapi.js
  - Restify
  - and others ...

The module is able to run in cluster mode (master/worker). 

# Status

Supported Node-Versions: Node >= 0.10, io.js >= 1.2

Please check our [blog](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/03/30/nodejs-iojs-monitoring/) for more information or
contact us at [npmjs@sematext.com](mailto:npmjs@sematext.com).

# Installation

```

    npm install spm-agent-nodejs

```

Get a free account and create a Node.js API token at [sematext.com/spm](https://apps.sematext.com/users-web/register.do)

# Configuration

We use https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc for configuration. This means config parameters can be passed via several config
locations commandline args or ENV variables. We recommend to use a file in current directory in INI or JSON format called ".spmagentrc".
This file can be generated by providing setting and environment variable and calling a helper script:

        export SPM_TOKEN=YOUR-SPM-TOKEN
        node ./node_modules/spm-agent-nodejs/bin/spmconfig.js

The command above generates following default configuration file:

        # Directory for buffered metrics
        dbDir = ./spmdb

        # Application Token for SPM
        [tokens]
          spm = YOUR-SPM-TOKEN

        [logger]
          # log file directory default is ./spmlogs
          dir = ./spmlogs
          # silent = true means no creation of log files
          silent = false
          # log level for output - debug, info, error, defaults to error to be quiet
          level = error


The only required setting is the SPM Application Token, this could be set via config file ".spmagentrc" or environment variable:

    export spmagent_tokens__spm=YOUR-SPM-APP-TOKEN

Please note the use of double "_" for nested properties


# Usage

Add this line at the begin of your source code / main script / app.js

```js
    var spmAgent = require ('spm-agent-nodejs')
```

There is an alternative using io.js (>1.6.4). It supports a command line option "-r" to preload node modules before the actual application is started. In this case the original source code needs no modification:

```sh
  iojs -r './spm-agent-nodejs' yourApp.js
```
